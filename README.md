# üêç Test Python Project

Tests a Python project and generates coverage reports.

There are two ways for tests to run:

- Using pytest and pytest-cov to run tests and generate coverage reports
- Using tox when provided with a suitable configuration file

## python-test-action

## Usage Example

The example below demonstrates an implementation as a matrix job:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->

```yaml
  python-tests:
    name: "Python Test"
    runs-on: "ubuntu-24.04"
    needs:
      - python-build
    #¬†Matrix job
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix: ${{ fromJson(needs.python-build.outputs.matrix_json) }}
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
      - name: "Test Python project"
        uses: lfreleng-actions/python-test-action@main
        with:
          python_version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
          report_artefact: true
```

Note: build your project before invoking tests (not shown above)

## Coverage Reports

The embedded pytest behaviour will create HTML coverage reports as ZIP file
bundles. Set REPORT_ARTEFACT true to also upload them to GitHub as artefacts.
